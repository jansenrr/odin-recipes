    <p>Lau lau is a polynesian dish that consists of taro leaves and meat (pork and butterfish), wrapped in ti leaf</p>
    <p>Traditionally it is cooked in an underground oven (an imu)</p>
    <p>However, most people now steam it on the stove</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork butt and/or pork belly</li>
        <li>Butterfish</li>
        <li>Taro leaves</li>
        <li>Ti leaves</li>
        <li>Hawaiian sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the ti leaves and taro leaves thoroughly</li>
        <li>Cut the stems of the taro leaves off, cut them into 1 inch long pieces, and set leaves aside</li>
        <li>Remove the stiff part of the stem on the ti leaf to make them more flexible</li>
        <li>Chop the pork and butterfish into 1 inch cubes (leave the fat!)</li>
        <li>Season meat with Hawaiian sea salt</li>
        <li>Place a few (3-5) taro leaves on each other, biggest at the bottom</li>
        <li>Add a handful of meat to the center</li>
        <li>Fold the taro leaves in (like a present) and pack it as tightly as you can</li>
        <li>Lay 2 ti leaves down in a plus shape and place the taro wrapped meat in the center</li>
        <li>Wrap the ti leaves in and tie the stems together to prevent it from falling apart (you may use butcher string if you can't tie it)</li>
        <li>Arrange all your laulau into a steamer and steam for 4 hours</li>
        <li>Remove laulau from steamer when done</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>To Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take one laulau and remove the ti leaf (you can't eat it)</li>
        <li>Place laulau on a bed of rice and break open with knife or fork</li>
        <li>You can add chili water on top if you would like</li>
        <li>Have at it!</li>
    </ol>
